# GUI representation of my STP Trainer

Author : Kamil Kugler

Hello guys! 

To properly run this program you will require at least python3.6 
(you might get away with a lower version of python3 but this is the one
I was testing it on). The main OS I was using is Ubuntu Linux but I 
believe it should also work in other flavour of Linux and possibly
windows 10 as well.

You would also require a tkinter to run a GUI application if it did not come
pre-installed and numpy if it was not already there either.

Moreover you could also just use my CLI version of this software :)

This software has been created in the will to help others to learn 
STP in a quick and effective manner. There are about 6 different 
pre-programmed STP Domains with 29 possible topologies to play with. 
That is without having to edit anything at all.

To have a random topology loaded for you just go back to the starting screen
and press the button at the bottom of it so you can practice even more.

You could always edit the files and add some of your own topologies
but I would only suggest you to try and change particular links
costs and do not change number of switches in topologies. However
you are free to add links between switches in 4, 5, 6 switches 
topologies if you are willing to test yourself even further.

One thing that this version does not provide is multiple links to
neighboring switches, at the moment I do not have established plans
to implement that feature and possibly never will (but it is rather
simple to define those ports anyway).

I have always considered the biggest challenge being to calculate\n 
all of the proper costs and figure out which ports belong to :
    
    - Blocking ports
    - Designated ports
    - Root ports

This is the functionality you get here. In according to this, your task
is to define which ports belong to which of aforementioned groups and than
press the button to see whether you were successful or not :)

The process can be a bit daunting at the start but as you get better it
will feel great to see that positive mark at the bottom of the screen
and will make you much more confident about your skills as well.

Moreover on top of what is mentioned above , you can also just get some 
more information about the switches that should help you to get rid of any
doubts in terms of a correct result.

I hope you are going to enjoy it as much as I did while creating it,
so without further do just press the button below to start all of the fun.
